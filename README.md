This study investigates how geospatial features score when passed through various feature selection functions. We experiment with four feature selection techniques (Pearson Correlation, Information Gain, Recursive Feature Elimination, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO), and one feature extraction algorithm (Principal Component Analysis, PCA), using water consumption datasets gathered from poor households in Nyanya-Mararaba Town in Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory.
